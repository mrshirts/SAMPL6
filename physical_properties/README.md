## Potential molecules for logD challenge

SAMPL6 Physical Property prediction challenge will consist of predicting distribution coefficients of kinase inhibitor fragment-like small molecules.
Currently Mehtap Isik from Dr. John Chodera's group is measuring experimental pKa and logD, in collaboration with Merck's Preformulation Group at Rahway.

14 compounds from the larger small molecule set, that are currently experimented on, are provided in `potential_molecules_for_logD_challenge.xlsx` as examples. These should be regarded as potential compounds for logD challenge until experiments are finalized. Future updates will be posted regarding final small molecule set for logD prediction challenge upon completion of pKa and logD experiments.
