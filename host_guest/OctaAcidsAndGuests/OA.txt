Method: 
All simulations were performed with the pmemd.cuda program from
AMBER14, using our attach-pull-release method (10.1002/jcc.23398,
10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405). Ten windows were used for the attach phase,
and umbrella sampling windows during the pull phase were spaced at 1
Angstrom intervals, and extended to a maximum distance of 25
Angstroms. As no restraints were added to the host itself, the work of
release could be computed purely analytically.

Each sampling window included a minimum of 50 ns simulation time, with
extension as needed to bring the standard error estimate of the
overall free energy within 0.5 kcal/mol. The longest sampling required
in any window was 125 ns. The bonded and initial Lennard-Jones
parameters were obtained from GAFF. Partial atomic charges were
generated with the RESP procedures as implemented in the program
Antechamber. Sodium or chloride counterions, with parameters from
Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614), were added only as needed to
neutralize the total charge of each host-guest system; no additional
counterions were added. The starting structures were obtained by
docking from MOE initially, but were relaxed through short preliminary
MD simulations. Each system was solvated with ~2000 TIP3P waters in an
orthorhombic box whose dimensions were approximately 36 x 36 x 52
cubic Angstroms.

Production simulations were run in the NPT ensemble, with temperature
control using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency 1.0 ps-1
and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat. Direct
space nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 9.0 Angstrom cutoff,
whereas long-range electrostatics were handled with the PME method,
using default AMBER settings. SHAKE constraints were applied to bonds
involving hydrogen, and the simulation time step was set to 2 fs.
